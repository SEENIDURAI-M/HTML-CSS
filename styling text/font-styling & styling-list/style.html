<h1>Tommy the cat</h1>

<p>Well I remember it as though it were a meal ago…</p>

<p>
  Said Tommy the Cat as he reeled back to clear whatever foreign matter may have
  nestled its way into his mighty throat. Many a fat alley rat had met its
  demise while staring point blank down the cavernous barrel of this awesome
  prowling machine. Truly a wonder of nature this urban predator — Tommy the cat
  had many a story to tell. But it was a rare occasion such as this that he did.
